# Microbial modeling: reading modeling journal paper

## Goals of lab

- Prepare to build the microbial model in the subsequent lab exercise.  
-	Practice translating a published model to model code
-	Practice building conceptual models

## Assignment

In this module, you will use your experience building models to construct a soil decomposition model based on the model description in a published paper.

Before the lab, read the [Allison et al. (2010)] paper and supplemental information (https://doi.org/10.1038/ngeo846). Then, come to class ready to build the two models (an Enzyme-driven model and a Conventional model) described in the paper.

Please come to class ready to discuss the paper and decide on the key finding that you'd like to reproduce.

In preparation for model building, please answer the following questions (Due by the end of lab).

**Question 1:**

What is the model currency?

**Answer 1:**

**Question 2:** 

What is the model time scale?

**Answer 2:**

**Question 3:**  

What is the model spatial scale?

**Answer 3:**

**Question 4:**

What are the model states?

**Answer 4:**

**Question 5:**

What are the model fluxes?

**Answer 5:**

**Question 6:**

What are the forcing inputs (environmental drivers) to the model?

**Answer 6:**

**Question 7:**

What initial conditions does the model require?

**Answer 7:**

**Question 8:** 

What are the model parameters?

**Answer 8:**

**Question 9:**

Draw a conceptual diagram of the Enzyme-driven model and label the fluxes with a number (f#).  Be sure to link to your figure in this Markdown, so it appears in the HTML you submit.

**Answer 9:**

**Question 10:**

Write the differential equations for the Enzyme-driven model states using the flux numbers from question 9. 

**Answer 10:**
