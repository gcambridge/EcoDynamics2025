##The efficient and easy solver package

I recommend using the `deSolve` package because it does the hard work for you, allowing you to focus on the science rather than the computation.  After defining the differential equation function (i.e., the science!), defining the parameters, and defining the initial conditions, the only command you need to solve the model is:

```
output <- ode(y = yini, times = times, func = simple_forest_model, parms = parms, method = "ode45"
```

Note that the function `ode` returns an array that has the time step values, states, and other values (the fluxes) as columns. Therefore, you need to examine the array first and reference the correct columns when visualizing and analyzing the output.  Just so you know, the names of the flux columns are weird because they attach extra names to the column name.

```{r}

#HERE IS OUR MODEL
simple_forest_model <- function(t, states, parms){
  
  #"UNPACK" STATES TO THE ACTUAL NAMES
  VEG <- states[1]
  SOIL <- states[2]

  #"UNPACK" parms TO THE ACTUAL NAMES
  npp <- parms[1]
  mortalityRate <- parms[2]
  krate <- parms[3]

  #WRITE FLUX EQUATIONS HERE
  VegGrowth <- npp 
  VegMortality <- VEG * mortalityRate
  SoilDecomposition <- SOIL * krate

  #WRITE DERIVATIVES HERE
  dVEG_dt <- VegGrowth - VegMortality
  dSOIL_dt <- VegMortality - SoilDecomposition

  #RETURN A LIST OF THE DERIVATIVES
  return(list(c(dVEG_dt = dVEG_dt, 
                dSOIL_dt = dSOIL_dt),
              c(VegGrowth = VegGrowth, 
                VegMortality = VegMortality, 
                SoilDecomposition = SoilDecomposition)))
}

#PARAMETERS
parms <- c(
  300,  #npp, g C m-2 yr-1
  0.02, #mortalityRate, yr-1
  0.01) # krate, yr-1

#INITIAL STATES (THE MODEL STARTING POINT)
yini <- c(
  veg = 1, #VEG, g C m-2
  soil = 1000) #SOIL, g C m-2

simulation_time <- 400 #YEARS
dt <- 10
times <- seq(1, simulation_time, by = dt)

#THIS IS WHERE THE MODEL IS RUN.  MAKE SURE THE FUNCTION ("func") 
#MATCHES YOUR FUNCTION NAME ABOVE
#"out" IS MODEL STATES AT EACH TIME STEP IN "times"
if (!"deSolve" %in% installed.packages()) install.packages("deSolve")
library(deSolve)

output <- ode(y = yini, 
              times = times, 
              func = simple_forest_model, 
              parms = parms, 
              method = "ode45",
              weather_df = noaa_data)

#-------------------------------------------------
#Actual solution

#note: x is time
solved_vegetation_model <- function(x, npp, mortalityRate){
  t <- x
  c <- (1 - (npp / mortalityRate))
  B <- (npp / mortalityRate) + c * exp(-mortalityRate * t)
}

#This is from the model
ylim <- range(c(output[, 2],output[, 3]))
plot(output[, 1], output[, 2], type = "l", col = "black", lty = "solid", 
     ylim = ylim, xlab = "time", ylab = "carbon stocks (g C m-2)")

      from = 1,to = 400, ylim = c(0, 50000), xlab = "time", 
      ylab = "vegetation biomass", col = "gray", lwd = 10, add = TRUE)
