# Final project for Ecosystem Dynamics

## Goals

-	Apply modeling skills to a new problem
-	Formulate and address a science question using differential equations
-	Practice presenting the development and application of an ecosystem model

For the final project, you will build and apply an ecosystem model to a science 
question of your choice.  Your project must include the construction of a model
but you are not necessarily required to construct an entirely new model.   
For example, you can add new equations to a model that we developed in class or
a model that you found in the literature.  
The closer the modeling relates to your graduate research, the better!  

It is important to remember that you should address a science question using your
model.  This requires designing an informative experiment with your model.  
Developing a complex model for the sake of modeling will not receive as good
of a grade as developing simpler model with a well-designed modeling experiment.  

You will provide an abstract that provides an overview of your project plant,
present your model and results in class (a 10 minute presentation including 
time for discussion and questions), and submit the Rmarkdown code description of
your model, the Kitted Rmarkdown code, and a pdf of your powerpoint presentation to Canvas.

## Your abstract must include

- The question you plan to address
- An overview of the model that you build to build
- The modeling experiment you plan to use to address your science question.
- Your draft conceptual model as a figure.
- Maximum of 400 words + 1 figure
- Submit as a knitted html to Canvas.

## Your presentation must include

-	The science question that your model is addressing and why that science question is important
-	Conceptual diagram of your model
-	A description of the spatial domain, temporal domain, and model currency
-	A description of your differential equations (walk the class through the equations)
-	Description of model experiment
-	Results (mostly figures) from model simulations
-	Conclusions, next steps, and key areas of uncertainty in your model

## Your written document should use Rmarkdown and include the following:

-	Model code in a readable format
-	Table of parameters (and justification)
-	Short description of how you set up your model simulations
-	The code that runs your model simulations
-	The code that produces your figures
